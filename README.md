## Title:

Video Game Sales Analysis Dashboard (Tableau)

## Executive Summary:

This project analyzes global video game sales data to identify trends in genre popularity, platform performance, publisher dominance, and yearly market growth. Using Tableau, an interactive dashboard was built to transform raw sales records into business insights about the evolution of the gaming industry from 1980 to 2020.

The dashboard allows exploration of which game genres sell the most, which platforms dominate specific eras, and how the market shifted over time. The goal is to understand industry patterns that influence game production, publishing strategy, and platform investment decisions.

## Business Problem:
Game publishers and studios must decide:
- Which genre to develop?
- Which platform to release on?
- Which market period to target?
- Whether to invest in sequels or new IPs?
Without historical analysis, decisions rely on intuition rather than evidence.

**_What types of games sell the most and how has the video game market evolved across platforms and years?_**
